            <p class="text">Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional
                graphics,
                manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972.
                <br>It was one of the earliest arcade video
                games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder
                Nolan Bushnell,
                <br>but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of
                Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game.
                <br>Bushnell based the game's concept on an
                electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console.
                <br>In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

                Atari is a brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by French
                publisher Atari SA,
                <br> through a subsidiary named Atari Interactive. The original Atari, Inc., founded in Sunnyvale,
                California, in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney,
                <br>was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles and home computers. The company's products,
                such as Pong and the Atari 2600,
                <br>helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.

        <p class="text2">
            Alcorn grew up in San Francisco, California, and attended the University of California, Berkeley,
            <br>graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences in
            1971.
            <br>He worked for the pioneering video company Ampex, where he met Ted Dabney and several other people
            that would end up being constants through the Atari,
            <br> Apple, Cyan Engineering and Pizza Time Theater (now known as Chuck E. Cheese's) companies.
            <br>Alcorn was the designer of the video arcade game Pong, creating it under the direction of Nolan
            Bushnell and Dabney. Pong was a hit in the 1970s.
